## 📌 How It Works

- The **TaskInput** component lets users add new tasks.  
- Each task appears in **TaskList**, and each individual task is managed via **TaskItem**.  
- Tasks can be marked completed or edited directly in the interface.  
- All components use React state and props for interaction and rendering.
